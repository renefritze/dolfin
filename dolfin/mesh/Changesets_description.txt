Added:

Mesh_d class: Template class to wrap the dimension independent mesh class into a
dimension dependent type.

CellBoostIterator class: More STL compliant iterator over of cells of mesh. 

IntersectionOperator class: Provides the interface for the new intersection functionality based
on the CGAL library (computational geometry). Implementation via the pImpl
idiom.

IntersectionOperatorImplementation class: Abstract base class for the pImpl
implementation. Only inherited classes contain the search tree, which type depends
is based on the geometric primitive it includes.

IntersectionOperatorImplementation_d class: Contains search tree for the mesh
and executes search operations.

Changed:

MeshEntity class:
- Introduced default constructor (requires to change private member const
Mesh & _mesh to const Mesh * _mesh)
- added comparison operator

MeshEntityInterator class:
- Introduced default constructor 
- added comparison operator
- added set_end function to create iterators which points past the end.
- synchronize immediately internal setting of position with entity index
  (otherwise ugly bugs could occur by using the comparison operator)
