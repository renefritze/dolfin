Timing of the evaluation of the local element tensor and the
assembly of the global matrix for the advection operator:

    a = v*c[i]*u.dx(i)*dx

where c is a piecewise constant convection.

Results 2006-11-22 (changeset 2448:de52acef02c0):

  AdvectionOperator_3D_3_FFC, local tensor: 3.003e-06 s
  AdvectionOperator_3D_3_FER, local tensor: 9.830e-07 s

  AdvectionOperator_3D_3_FFC, global assembly: 1.961e-01 s
  AdvectionOperator_3D_3_FER, global assembly: 1.856e-01 s

  Speedup, local tensor:    3.05
  Speedup, global assembly: 1.06

Results from callgrind (valgrind --tool=callgrind):

  relative time (global time)

  assembleCommon()   100.0%  (97.85%)

    PETScMatrix::add()      79.5%  (77.78%)
    BilinearForm::eval()     7.6%  ( 7.47%)
    other                   12.9%

  "other" includes initialization of assembly data structures,
  iteration over the mesh, computing the affine map and interpolating
  the coefficients (the advection velocity) on each element

Sanity check:

  The evaluation of the element tensor accounts for 7.6% of the assembly
  and the speedup of this evaluation by FErari compared to plain FFC is a
  factor 3.05. This means the global speedup should be a factor

      1 / (1 - 0.076 + 0.076/3.05) = 1.06

  Should thus give about 5% speedup. Measured speedup is 6% (varying
  between 5% and 9%).
