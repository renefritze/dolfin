This test program solves 2 benchmark problems of incompressible 
flow modelled by the Navier-Stokes equations: 

- 3d benchmark problem with Re = 3900, described in 
  http://www.nada.kth.se/~jhoffman/archive/papers/cc.pdf

- Benchmark problem: 2D-3, defined in
  http://www.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~featflow/ture/paper/benchmark_results.ps.gz
