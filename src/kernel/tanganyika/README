A historical note:
------------------

A large part of the code in this directory has been copied (and then
modified for DOLFIN) from the multi-adaptive ODE-solver Tanganyika,
version 1.2.1. (Also some other parts from Tanganyika, such as the
quadrature rules, have been integrated into DOLFIN.)

Starting at versions DOLFIN 0.3.5 and Tanganyika 1.2.1, we thus merge
Tanganyika with DOLFIN. From this point, Tanganyika is no longer
maintained but exists within DOLFIN.
