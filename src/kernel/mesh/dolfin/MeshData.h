  ///
  ///   (x) n-n (the vertex neighbors of a vertex)  [5, from 4]
  ///   (x) n-c (the cell neighbors of a vertex)  [1, from 0]
  ///   (x) n-e (the edge neighbors of a vertex)  [4, from 3]
  ///       n-f (the face neighbors of a vertex)
  ///
  ///   (x) c-n (the vertices within a cell)       [0]
  ///   (x) c-c (the cell neighbors of a cell)  [2, from 0 and 1]
  ///   (x) c-e (the edges within a cell)       [3, from 0 and 2]
  ///   (x) c-f (the faces within a cell)       [6, from 0 and 2]
  ///
  ///   (x) e-n (the vertices within an edge)      [3, from 0 and 2]
  ///   (x) e-c (the cell neighbors of an edge) [7, from 3
  ///       e-e (the edge neighbors of an edge)
  ///       e-f (the face neighbors of an edge)
  ///
  ///       f-n (the vertices within a face)
  ///   (x) f-c (the cell neighbors of a face)  [8, from 6]

  /// - Two vertices are neighbors if they are part of the same edge.
  ///   Each vertex is a neighbor to itself.
  /// - Two cells are neighbors if they share a common edge.
