Use this as a template to create your own modules.

Instructions:
-------------

	1. Copy these files to a new directory in src/modules
	which has the same name as your new module.

	2. Replace all occurences of "template" with the name
	of your module and edit the .module file.

	3. Include your files in the build system by editing
	the files configure.in and src/modules/Makefile.am

	4. Thats all! Now rebuild by

		./scripts/preconfigure
		./configure
		make
