PyDOLFIN - A Python module wrapper for DOLFIN

Introduction:

The idea behind PyDOLFIN is that DOLFIN should be usable from
Python. This enables much simpler testing, experimenting,
demonstration. For some applications it could likely replace the C++
interface entirely.

Installation:

PyDOLFIN requires a correctly configured DOLFIN source tree, as well
as an installation of DOLFIN. With that in place, simply type "make"
in "src/pydolfin" to build the module, then "python setup.py install"
to install it (a standard Python module installation
procedure). Possibly "python setup.py install
--prefix=/your/local/directory/" if you do not wish a system-wide
install.

Usage:

PyDOLFIN is used just like any Python module:

>>> from dolfin import *
>>> dolfin_get("tolerance")
0.10000000000000001
>>> 

See the included demos for usage examples, for example
"settingsdemo.py".
