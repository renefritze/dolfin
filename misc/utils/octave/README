Notes about the pdeplot, pdesurf and pdemesh Octave functions:

These functions are Free Software reimplementations of the corresponding
functions in Matlab's PDE Toolbox.

They require the external program "ivview" included in the open source
Open Inventor distribution which can be obtained from

	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/.

Open Inventor also exists in the package system of some Linux
distributions, such as Debian (the package inventor-clients).

They have been verified to work in Octave 2.1.50.

Example usage:

> pdemesh(points, edges, cells)
> pdesurf(points, cells, u)

Bugs and comments on features:

The functions use the "popen2" call in Octave to communicate with
"ivview", and this does not always work correctly, "ivview" can
sometimes hang. This is presumably an Octave bug.

The pdeplot function is a far from complete reimplementation of the 
Matlab pdeplot.
