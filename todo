Multi-adaptive solver
---------------------

- Computation of residuals
- Adaptive time-stepping: implement regulator
- Solution of the dual problem
- Error estimates
- Saving the solution: new version of the Function class?
- Optimization and benchmarks, including control of the error estimates
- Automatic computation of stability factors as function of time T
- Stiff problems, adaptive damping
- Examples: Lorenz, sin-cos, stiff problems, cow, solar system

General
-------

- Save edges in matlab format
- General boundary conditions
- Multigrid
- Grid generation (octree) from given CAD model
- Vector valued PDE
