Multi-adaptive solver
---------------------

- Computation of residuals
- Adaptive time-stepping: implement regulator
- Solution of the dual problem
- Error estimates
- Saving the solution: new version of the Function class?
- Optimization and benchmarks, including control of the error estimates
- Automatic computation of stability factors as function of time T
- Stiff problems, adaptive damping
- Examples: Lorenz, sin-cos, stiff problems, cow, solar system

General
-------

- Optimize form evaluation: Hoffman, Logg
- Save edges in matlab format: Svensson?
- General boundary conditions: Kraft?
- Multigrid: Svensson, Målqvist?
- Vector valued PDE: Hoffman, Logg (Bengzon, Jansson ?)
- General function representations: Hoffman, Logg, Jansson
- i/o for functions, in particular in OpenDX format: Logg
- Use libtool: anyone?
- Replace stdio with iostream and fstream
- Replace Array and List with NewArray and NewList
- Replace int by unsigned int where necessary
