Requirements
------------

DOLFIN uses a SCons-based build system. You will there need SCons to build
and install DOLFIN. SCons is available as a package for most operating systems.
Alternatively, it can be found at www.scons.org.

DOLFIN depends on various packages. Details of the dependencies can found at 

  http://www.fenics.org/wiki/Installing_DOLFIN


Simple build and install
--------------------------

In the directory containing the DOLFIN source code, type

  scons enableDemos=yes

This will configure and build DOLFIN and the demo programs. To install the 
library, type

  scons install prefix=PREFIX

which will install DOLFIN files in PREFIX. Depending on where DOLFIN has been
installed, it may be necessary to set various environment variables. A helper 
file 'dolfin.conf' is generated to do this for bash shell users. Type

  source ./dolfin.conf

to set the necessary variables. It should now be possible to run the demo 
programs. To install locally (within the DOLFIN tree), type

  ./scons.local


Customised builds
-----------------

Various options for building DOLFIN are printed to the screen by typing

  scons -h
