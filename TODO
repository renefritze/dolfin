This file lists TODO items for DOLFIN. As usual, the priority depends
on the current interests of the various DOLFIN developers.

To edit this file, it is convenient to install org-mode in Emacs.
It is available as part of Emacs 22 and can be invoked by M-x org-mode.
This gives convenient expand/collapse of bullets by pressing TAB.

* Parallelisation

** Reordering in DofMap
** Generalise Assembler for parallel assembly
   - Should be possible to do with minor changes
   - Add something similar to what is done now for assembling
     over subdomains:

     if (partition(*cell) != this_process)
       continue;

** Figure out what to do with Functions in parallel
** Parallelize necessary parts of Mesh
   - Store both global and local indices for cell/vertex, add mesh
     functions for this
   - IO: read/write mesh in parallel (each processor reads/writes only
     its own part), should be doable with small extension of
     MeshEditor and XMLMesh
   - Adapt BoundaryComputation for parallel mesh, use knowledge about
     which vertices are shared to decide if a facet is a global or
     local boundary
   - Use parallel mesh information in DofMap to simplify
     implementation - should only need map from local to global cell/vertex
   - Use parallel mesh information in ParMETIS partitioning implementation

* Manual

** Write incomplete sections
