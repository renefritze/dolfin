UFC, Unified Form-assembly Code, is the interface between the form compiler, FFC,
and the DOLFIN problem solving environment. You can, in principle, code your own
finite elements and weak forms using the UFC interface to "save" you from using
the UFL language to specify forms and elements and FFC to compile the forms to
C++. In practice very few people implement code for the UFC interface by hand.
