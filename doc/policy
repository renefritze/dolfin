Guidelines for writing DOLFIN code.
-----------------------------------

In order to streamline the code a bit perhaps we should
keep sort of the same style when writing the code.

- Naming of classes:

		GridGeometry.h

  Class files are named exactly the same as the class.

- Naming of variables: undecided

- Naming of functions: undecided

- Header files end with.h, implementation files with .cpp

- Large letter only for class files: utils.h

- DOLFIN constants start with DOLFIN and large letters:

		DOLFIN_BCTYPE_DIRICHLET

- Header files start and end with something like

		#ifndef __GRID_GEOMETRY_H
		#define __GRID_GEOMETRY_H

		...

		#endif

- Applying the GPL should look something like this at the top
  of all source files:

	// (c) 2002 Johan Hoffman & Anders Logg, Chalmers Finite Element Center.
	// Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.

  or

	// (c) 1999 Rickard Bergström, Chalmers Finite Element Center.
	// Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.
	//
	// Modifications by:
	//
	//   Johan Hoffman, Chalmers Finite Element Center
	//   Anders Logg,   Chalmers Finite Element Center

- Include private header files as

	#include "file.h"

  and public header files as

	#include <dolfin/file.h>

  Private headers are those only used internally. Public headers are those
  that should be installed on the system.
