Guidelines for writing DOLFIN code.
-----------------------------------

In order to streamline the code a bit perhaps we should
keep sort of the same style when writing the code.

- Naming of classes:

	GridGeometry

- Naming of files:

	GridGeometry.h
	GridGeometry.cpp	

  Class files are named exactly the same as the class.
  Header files end with.h, implementation files with .cpp
  Large letter only for class files: utils.h

- Naming of variables: undecided

- Naming of functions: undecided

- DOLFIN constants start with DOLFIN and large letters:

	DOLFIN_PI

- Header files start and end with something like

	#ifndef __GRID_GEOMETRY_H
	#define __GRID_GEOMETRY_H

	...

	#endif

- Applying the GPL should look something like this at the top
  of all source files:

	// Copyright (c) 2003 Johan Hoffman and Anders Logg.
	// Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.

  or
