\subsection{Downloading the source code}
\index{downloading}
\index{source code}

The latest release of \package{} can be obtained as a \texttt{tar.gz}
archive in the download section at
\begin{code}
 http://www.fenics.org/
\end{code}

Download the latest release of \package{}, for example \texttt{\packagett{}-0.1.0.tar.gz},
and unpack using the command
\begin{macrocode}
# tar zxfv \packagett{}-0.1.0.tar.gz
\end{macrocode}

This creates a directory \texttt{\packagett{}-0.1.0} containing the
\package{} source code.

If you want the very latest version of \package{}, there is also a
version named \texttt{\packagett{}-cvs-current.tar.gz} which provides a
snapshot of the current CVS version of \package{}, updated
automatically from the CVS repository each hour. This version may
contain features not yet present in the latest release, but may also
be less stable and even not work at all.
