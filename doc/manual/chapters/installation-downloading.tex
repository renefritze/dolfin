\subsection{Downloading the source code}
\index{downloading}
\index{source code}

The latest release of \package{} can be obtained as a \texttt{tar.gz}
archive in the download section at
\begin{code}
 http://www.fenics.org/
\end{code}

Download the latest release of \package{}, for example \texttt{\packagett{}-x.y.z.tar.gz},
and unpack using the command
\begin{macrocode}
# tar zxfv \packagett{}-x.y.z.tar.gz
\end{macrocode}

This creates a directory \texttt{\packagett{}-x.y.z} containing the
\package{} source code.

If you want the very latest version of \package{}, it can be accessed
directly from the development repository through \texttt{hg}
(Mercurial):
\begin{macrocode}
# hg clone http://www.fenics.org/hg/\packagett{}
\end{macrocode}
This version may contain features not yet present in the latest
release, but may also be less stable and even not work at all.
