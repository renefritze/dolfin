This demo illustrates how to:

* Maintain symmetry when assembling a system of symmetric equations
  with essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions

* Define a preconditioner explicitly using a form

Strong form of the Stokes equations
-----------------------------------

The incompressible Stokes equations in strong form read: for a domain
:math:`\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n`, find the velocity :math:`u` and
the pressure :math:`p` satisfying

.. math::
   - \nabla \cdot (\nabla u + p I) &= f \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega, \\
                    \nabla \cdot u &= 0 \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega. \\


.. note::

   The sign of the pressure has been flipped from the classical
   definition. This is done in order to have a symmetric (but not
   positive-definite) system of equations rather than a non-symmetric
   (but positive-definite) system of equations.

A typical set of boundary conditions on the boundary :math:`\partial
\Omega = \Gamma_{D} \cup \Gamma_{N}` can be:

.. math::
                           u &= u_0 \quad {\rm on} \ \Gamma_{D}, \\
      \nabla u \cdot n + p n &= g   \quad {\rm on} \ \Gamma_{N}. \\


Weak form of the Stokes equations
---------------------------------

The Stokes equations can easily formulated in a mixed variational
form; that is, a form where the two variables, the velocity and the
pressure, are approximated simultaneously. Using the abstract
framework, we have the problem: find :math:`(u, p) \in W` such that

.. math::
   a((u, p), (v, q)) = L((v, q))

for all :math:`(v, q) \in W` where

.. math::
   a((u, p), (v, q))
   &= \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v
                    + \nabla \cdot v \ p
                    + \nabla \cdot u \ q \, {\rm d} x, \\
   L((v, q))
   &= \int_{\Omega} f \cdot v {\rm d} x
      + \int_{\partial \Omega_N} g \cdot v \, {\rm d} s. \\

The space `W` should be a mixed (product) function space: :math:`W = V
\times Q` such that :math:`u \in V` and :math:`q \in Q`.
