Problem definition
------------------

In this demo we focus on how to mark sub domains, so we do not have any equations to solve. 
The mesh we will work on is a unit square where the shape of a dolphin is removed from the middle of the square. 
This mesh and the sub domain markers produced by this demo program are the ones used
for the Stokes demo programs.
We will mark the boundaries so that the boundary to the right (x = 1) is inflow, 
the boundary to the left (x = 0) is outflow, and the top, bottom and the interior boundary 
around the dolphin will be noslip.
Thus, we have 

.. math::
	\partial \Omega &= \Gamma_{\mathrm{inflow}} \cup \Gamma_{\mathrm{outflow}} \cup \Gamma_{\mathrm{noslip}}, \\
	\Gamma_{\mathrm{inflow}} &= (1, y), \\
	\Gamma_{\mathrm{outflow}} &= (0, y), \\
	\Gamma_{\mathrm{noslip}} &= \partial \Omega \backslash (\Gamma_{\mathrm{inflow}} \cup \Gamma_{\mathrm{outflow}}). \\

The mesh with marked boundaries looks as follows:
