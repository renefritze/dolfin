This demo illustrates how to:

* Define Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
* Generate mesh from geometries

The domain looks as follows:

And the mesh looks as follows:


Problem definition
------------------

We do not have any equation in this demo. The demo focuses purely on the geometry and how to generate a mesh from it.
