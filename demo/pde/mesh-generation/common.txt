This demo illustrates how to:

* generate 2D mesh of a polygon
* generate 3D mesh of a polyhedral using .off files


Equation and problem definition
-------------------------------

We do not have any equation in this demo. The demo focuses purely on generating meshes. In this demo we will use the following classes in dolfin:

* :py:class:`PolygonalMeshGenerator <dolfin.cpp.mesh.PolygonalMeshGenerator>`
* :py:class:`PolyhedralMeshGenerator <dolfin.cpp.mesh.PolyhedralMeshGenerator>`
