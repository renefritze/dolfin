# The bilinear form a(u, v) and linear form L(v) for a multimesh
# formulation of the Stokes equations.
#
# Compile this form with FFC: ffc -l dolfin MultiMeshStokes.ufl.

# Define element
P2 = VectorElement("Lagrange", triangle, 2)
P1 = FiniteElement("Lagrange", triangle, 1)
TH = P2 * P1

# Define trial and test functions and right-hand side
(u, p) = TrialFunctions(TH)
(v, q) = TestFunctions(TH)
f = Coefficient(P2)

# Define facet normal and mesh size
n = FacetNormal(triangle)
h = 2.0*Circumradius(triangle)
h = (h('+') + h('-')) / 2

# Parameters
alpha = 4.0
