This directory contains unit tests for the FEniCS book:

  Automated Solution of Differential Equations
  by the Finite Element Method

These tests ensure that the examples presented in the book
continue to work with future versions of DOLFIN.

When we do need to break the unit tests for the book, those changes
should be listeed in this file:

* DOLFIN 1.3: Move parameter "linear_solver" from NonlinearVariationalSolver
  to NewtonSolver and PETScSNESSolver.

  - python/chapter_1_files/stationary/nonlinear_poisson/vp1_np.py: change parameters
  - python/chapter_1_files/stationary/nonlinear_poisson/vp2_np.py: change parameters
  - python/chapter_10.py: change parameters
