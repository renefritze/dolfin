The regression test currently consists of running (almost) all demos.

Ideally, we should also store MD5 sums or similar of the output from
all demos (VTK output etc) and compare against this output when running
the tests. For this to work, we also need to add an option for storing
solutions with limited precision so that round-off errors won't affect
the tests.
